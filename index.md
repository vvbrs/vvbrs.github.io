# About

Currently, I am researching the occupational stratification of the Netherlands as part of my internship at [Statistics Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb) and master’s thesis. Besides doing research, I am studying for the master’s programmes: [Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) and [European Master in Official Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/european-statistical-system/emos). In May 2021 I will be graduated and will be ready for a position involving quantitative social research, as I am interested in analyzing data, social constructs and improving research methodologies.
